_last run with: **node 12.16.1, npm 6.13.7**_

## Run the App

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`

3. Ensure **Strapi CMS** is running in order to see content.  You can check it out from: **git@github.com:ryshe/mysite.cms.git** and follow its readme instructions.

Site runs on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Some Context

Why is the app so basic and meh?

- Less than 24 hrs of work in an effort to get ramped up on **React w/ Next.js & Material-UI**
- Opportunity to show how I work/think through things.
- Strapi was chosen as the CMS because it was something I needed to explore anyways for my current job.

## Future

- Refactor/Reorganize the code to establish a better foundation.
- Get to Production Ready so I can launch a site to host my resume info, sample projects, etc. _(make sure to ask me about what production ready means to me)_
